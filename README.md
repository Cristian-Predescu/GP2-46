# GP2-46
Computer Science Development Exercise

First time using this it just gave me the option to add a readme file I'll live it because it will look better for when I do screenshots



Play around with github because if we are going to be in the same group for GP3 then we will most likely need to use this more often

Please make sure you add a text file with your name on it just so I can show that the whole team engaged with the repository
